# person-picker

## Description

A simple app that allows the user to enter names, submit them, get a random name returned, then reset to pick another name. Once a name has been picked it becomes less likely to be picked again. This is done by keeping track of who has been picked and how any times. This information is used to add ever name to a pool to be picked from multiple times depending on how many times the name has been picked already.
